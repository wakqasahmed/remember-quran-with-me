# Remember Quran with me
Remember Quran with me is a collaborative real-time application mainly for Huffaz حُفَّاظ‎‎ (The Guardian/Memorizers of The Glorious Quran).

## StoryLine:
Ramadan is the sacred month with quite a lot of blessings and characteristics, one of which is the:

### Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم) where he would recite and listen Quran to and from Angel Gabriel (عليه السلام) respectively.

Today, when everything is revolutionized by the usage of technology, why not revive this sunnah at massive scale by making it easy and available for everyone around the world. Remember Quran with me is a small initiative with a big vision to revive the lost treasures of Islam (This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion. [Quran 5:3]).

Finding a person physically is cumbersome these days due to busy lives and as everyone has their own schedule, through 'Remember Quran' reciters can do the drill anytime. Don't forget that listening equally benefits the memorization, so be the listener and the reciter interchangbly.

## Who can benefit from it?
* Huffaz
* Nazra Reciters
* both of the above as Listeners

## How it works (or should work):
1) Register/Login

2) Everytime choose either to be a reciter or listener (one at a time)

3) If listener: you are gonna see a list of reciters awaiting for listeners to engage with

4) If reciter: express your intent of recitation by choosing juz/surah and range of verses. wait for a listener for invitation to start

5) Reciter recites and listener logs the mistakes.

6) Reciter completes recitation and says 'صدق الله العظيم' and the session is over.

7) Reciter looks into the progress how he/she performed.
